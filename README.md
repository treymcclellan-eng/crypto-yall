## 1. System Overview

### What it does

Three trading bots run independently on the same Hyperliquid account. Each bot:
- Pulls market data (yfinance for daily, Hyperliquid candles for intraday)
- Computes technical signals (2-pole Butterworth oscillator + HMM regime classifier for the daily bot)
- Compares its current positions to what the strategy says they should be
- Places market orders to reconcile
- Logs every fill to a private GitHub Gist
- Sends email + Telegram alerts on every execution

### What it trades

Seven perpetual futures pairs on Hyperliquid:
- **Large caps** (3x max leverage, shorting allowed): BTC, ETH
- **Mid caps** (1.5x max leverage, shorting allowed): SOL, AVAX, LINK, SUI, XRP, ZEC, NEAR, HYPE, VVV

> **Note:** LINK and XRP are not listed on Hyperliquid **testnet**. Both will be available on mainnet. The bots automatically skip unavailable assets.

### Strategy types

- **Mean reversion** with regime gate (Daily bot)
- **Mean reversion** pure oscillator (Intraday Standard bot)
- **Mean reversion** with pyramiding + tighter thresholds (Aggressive bot)

All three use the same core 2-pole Butterworth low-pass filter and z-score normalized oscillator — but with different parameters and timeframes.

---

## 2. The Three Bots

### Bot 1: Daily (Conservative)

**File:** `hyperliquid_executor.py`
**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/execute-trades.yml`
**Schedule:** Daily at 00:15 UTC (often delayed 30-60min by GitHub Actions free tier)
**State Gist:** `d35732f9c123e95a4dc13a51855d21de` (`TRADING_GIST_ID`)

**Strategy:**
- Pulls daily OHLCV from yfinance (anchored to 2022-03-01 start date for fold stability)
- Computes HMM regimes (Bull / Bear / Chop)
- Generates signals based on regime + 2-pole oscillator + volatility-scaled momentum + ATR Chandelier exit
- Aggressive mode active by default (probabilistic leverage, pyramiding, shorting)

**Risk Controls:**
- Capital: $10,000 mock (testnet) / configurable on mainnet
- Position size: 1% of capital per trade
- Max positions: 4 concurrent
- Daily drawdown halt: 5%
- Kill switch: `KILL_SWITCH` GitHub variable (ON / OFF)

**When it fires:**
- Once per day, ~00:15 UTC
- Only places trades when signals change (open / close / sync) or when bot state is out of sync with strategy state

---

### Bot 2: Intraday Standard

**File:** `intraday_executor.py`
**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/execute-intraday.yml`
**Schedule:** Every hour at :05 UTC
**State Gist:** `02cbe06fb1c4eb8afb5fad321aa3a251` (`INTRADAY_GIST_ID`)

**Strategy:**
- Pulls 1-hour candles directly from Hyperliquid (no auth needed)
- Pure 2-pole oscillator, no HMM regime filter
- Z-score normalized oscillator with ±0.5 thresholds
- Long when oscillator crosses up through -0.5
- Short when oscillator crosses down through +0.5 (only large caps)
- Exit on zero crossing OR 2x ATR stop

**Risk Controls:**
- Capital: $5,000 mock
- Position size: 1% of capital per trade
- Leverage: 2x fixed
- Max positions: 2 concurrent
- Daily drawdown halt: 5%
- Kill switch: `INTRADAY_KILL_SWITCH` GitHub variable

**When it fires:**
- Every hour
- Aimed at Josh's manual approach with his members — active mean reversion on 1h timeframe

---

### Bot 3: Aggressive

**File:** `aggressive_executor.py`
**Workflow:** `.github/workflows/execute-aggressive.yml`
**Schedule:** Every 30 minutes
**State Gist:** `0917280713a7781dc72a984147eef295` (`AGGRESSIVE_GIST_ID`)

**Strategy:**
- Same z-score 2-pole oscillator but on 30-minute candles
- Tighter ±0.25 entry thresholds (vs ±0.5 standard) → more entries
- **Pyramiding**: can add up to 2 extra positions on existing winners when oscillator re-tests entry zone
- 1.5x ATR stop loss (tighter than standard's 2x)
- Fires ~3x more signals than standard intraday

**Risk Controls:**
- Capital: $3,000 mock
- Position size: 1.5% per trade + 0.5% per pyramid add (max 2 adds = 2.5% total per asset)
- Leverage: 4x large caps (capped at 3x by Hyperliquid), 2x mid caps
- Max positions: 4 concurrent
- Daily drawdown halt: 3% (tighter than other bots to control extra risk)
- Kill switch: `AGGRESSIVE_KILL_SWITCH` GitHub variable

**When it fires:**
- Every 30 minutes
- Built for traders who want high activity

## 3. Performance to Date

**As of June 11, 2026 (50 days on testnet):**

| Bot | Starting | Current | Net P&L | Open Positions |
|-----|----------|---------|---------|----------------|
| Daily | $999.00 | **$1,027.29** | **+2.83%** | BTC short @ $66,109 |
| Intraday | $999.00 | **$1,026.06** | **+2.71%** | SOL long, AVAX long |
| Aggressive | $999.00 | **$1,024.88** | **+2.59%** | BTC, ETH, SOL, SUI longs |

### Market context

- **BTC: -25% over the same period** ($77,500 → ~$63,500)
- **ETH: -25%**
- All three bots produced **positive returns in a sharply declining market**

### Trade counts

| Bot | Total trades | Trades/week |
|-----|--------------|-------------|
| Daily | 18 | ~3 |
| Intraday | 81 | ~12 |
| Aggressive | 42 (in 13 days) | ~22 |

### Aggressive bot historical backtest

If the aggressive bot had run since inception (Apr 22), backtest shows:
- Final equity: $979.62
- Net: -1.94% over 7 weeks
- 258 hypothetical trades, 30.6% win rate, avg win +$0.75 / avg loss -$0.44

The losses concentrated in April / mid-May choppy markets. Performance accelerated once directional moves started in late May.

### What this validates

1. **Capital preservation works in chop** — early period was ~flat
2. **Trend capture works in directional moves** — late period produced strong positive returns
3. **Risk controls fire correctly** — intraday halted on Apr 27 (-5.15% DD), resumed next day
4. **Strategies are complementary** — daily catches slow trends, intraday catches swings, aggressive captures small moves

### Data flow

1. **GitHub Actions** triggers each bot on its schedule
2. Each bot **fetches market data** (yfinance for daily, Hyperliquid for intraday/30m)
3. Computes **signals** using its strategy module
4. Loads **prior state** from its private GitHub Gist (owned positions, drawdown tracking)
5. Calls **Hyperliquid API** to read current account state + place market orders
6. Sends **email + Telegram notifications** on fills
7. Writes **updated state** back to its Gist
8. **Streamlit dashboard** reads the Gists in real-time to display positions, P&L, trade history

### Why GitHub Gists for state

- Free, private, version-controlled
- No database needed
- Survives container restarts (Streamlit Cloud, GitHub Actions)
- Each bot has its own Gist for clean separation

### Why GitHub Actions for execution

- Free CI/CD with cron support
- Runs on Azure cloud (non-US, helps with Hyperliquid US restriction concerns)
- Built-in secret management
- Logs every run for debugging

### Shared Hyperliquid account model

All three bots use the **same Hyperliquid account** but each tracks its own positions via `owned_coins` in its Gist. Two side effects:

1. **Positions can net on the exchange** — if Daily opens ETH long and Aggressive opens ETH short, Hyperliquid sees the net.
2. **Margin is shared** — total margin usage is summed across all three bots.

**Note on sub-accounts:** Hyperliquid sub-accounts would give each bot its own segregated margin account and eliminate netting. However, they require $100,000+ in mainnet trading volume to unlock, so they're unavailable to most users. The shared-account model works fine with the built-in ownership tracking — netting is a minor efficiency issue, not a safety one.

## 8. Operating the System

### Trigger a manual run

```bash
gh workflow run execute-trades.yml      # Daily bot
gh workflow run execute-intraday.yml    # Intraday Standard bot
gh workflow run execute-aggressive.yml  # Aggressive bot
gh workflow run signal-check.yml        # Signal alert checker
gh workflow run test-trade.yml          # Connection test
```

### Watch a workflow run

```bash
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log | grep -E "(executor|filled|Error)"
gh run list --workflow=execute-aggressive.yml --limit 5
```

### Check current bot state

```bash
# Daily
gh gist view d35732f9c123e95a4dc13a51855d21de -f trading_state.json | jq '.last_equity, .open_positions, .owned_coins'

# Intraday
gh gist view 02cbe06fb1c4eb8afb5fad321aa3a251 -f intraday_state.json | jq '.last_equity, .open_positions'

# Aggressive
gh gist view 0917280713a7781dc72a984147eef295 -f aggressive_state.json | jq '.last_equity, .open_positions, .pyramid_state'
```

### Pause a single bot (kill switch)

```bash
gh variable set KILL_SWITCH -b "OFF"             # halts Daily bot
gh variable set INTRADAY_KILL_SWITCH -b "OFF"    # halts Intraday Standard
gh variable set AGGRESSIVE_KILL_SWITCH -b "OFF"  # halts Aggressive

# Resume
gh variable set KILL_SWITCH -b "ON"
```

### Pause ALL bots

```bash
gh variable set KILL_SWITCH -b "OFF"
gh variable set INTRADAY_KILL_SWITCH -b "OFF"
gh variable set AGGRESSIVE_KILL_SWITCH -b "OFF"
```

> **Note:** Kill switch only prevents new orders. Existing positions stay open. To close everything, disable kill switches, then manually close positions on Hyperliquid UI, then re-enable.

### Reset signal state (force re-alert)

```bash
gh gist edit ad73d92e1fa245c2725e06f60d68d13b -f signal_state.json - <<< '{}'
gh workflow run signal-check.yml
```

### Reset a bot's owned-coins tracking (caution)

If a bot's `owned_coins` gets out of sync with actual Hyperliquid positions:

```bash
# Edit the Gist directly, set "owned_coins" to actual coins held
# Or wipe entirely:
gh gist edit d35732f9c123e95a4dc13a51855d21de -f trading_state.json - <<< '{}'
```

The bot will rebuild state on its next run. Note: trade history will be lost.

## 9. Making Changes

### Change capital allocation

| Variable | Current | What it controls |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| `SEGREGATED_CAPITAL` | `10000` | Daily bot capital |
| `INTRADAY_CAPITAL` | `5000` | Intraday Standard capital |
| `AGGRESSIVE_CAPITAL` | `3000` | Aggressive bot capital |

```bash
gh variable set AGGRESSIVE_CAPITAL -b "5000"
```

### Change drawdown halt thresholds

| Variable | Current | What it controls |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| `DAILY_DD_PCT` | `5` | Daily bot daily DD halt |
| `INTRADAY_DD_PCT` | `5` | Intraday Standard daily DD halt |
| `AGGRESSIVE_DD_PCT` | `3` | Aggressive bot daily DD halt |

### Change max concurrent positions

| Variable | Current | What it controls |
|----------|---------|------------------|
| `MAX_POSITIONS` | `4` | Daily bot max positions |
| `INTRADAY_MAX_POSITIONS` | `2` | Intraday Standard max |
| `AGGRESSIVE_MAX_POSITIONS` | `4` | Aggressive bot max |

### Change strategy thresholds (requires code change)

**Intraday Standard** — edit `intraday_strategy.py`:
```python
OSC_UPPER = 0.5          # ↓ for more entries, ↑ for fewer
OSC_LOWER = -0.5
ATR_STOP_MULT = 2.0      # ↓ for tighter stops
```

**Aggressive** — edit `aggressive_strategy.py`:
```python
OSC_UPPER = 0.25         # current — tighter than standard
OSC_LOWER = -0.25
ATR_STOP_MULT = 1.5      # current — tighter
BW_CUTOFF_30M = 0.1      # filter aggressiveness
SMA_PERIOD_30M = 20      # smoothing window
```

After editing:
```bash
git add intraday_strategy.py && git commit -m "Tune intraday thresholds" && git push
```

Changes take effect on the next scheduled run.

### Change position sizing

**Edit the executor's constants:**

`hyperliquid_executor.py` line ~65:
```python
POSITION_SIZE_PCT = 0.01  # 1% per trade
```

`aggressive_executor.py` line ~44-45:
```python
POSITION_SIZE_PCT = 0.015  # 1.5% per trade
PYRAMID_SIZE_PCT = 0.005   # 0.5% per pyramid add
```

### Change leverage

**Daily bot:** edit `backtester.py` `ASSET_PROFILES` dict — change `max_bull_leverage`

**Intraday Standard:** edit `intraday_executor.py` line ~277:
```python
leverage = 2.0  # Fixed 2x
```

**Aggressive:** edit `aggressive_executor.py` line ~258:
```python
leverage = min(4.0, profile["max_bull_leverage"] * 1.33)
```

### Change cron schedules

Edit the `.github/workflows/*.yml` files:

```yaml
on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '*/30 * * * *'    # Every 30 min
    - cron: '15 0 * * *'      # Daily 00:15 UTC
    - cron: '5 * * * *'       # Every hour at :05
```

> **GitHub Actions free tier note:** Cron schedules are best-effort. Expect 30-60min delays. Critical timing requires paid tier or self-hosted runners.

### Add a new asset

1. Add to `ASSETS` dict in `hyperliquid_executor.py`, `intraday_executor.py`, `aggressive_executor.py`, `notifier.py`, `app.py`, `data_loader.py`
2. Add Hyperliquid symbol mapping to `HL_TICKER_MAP` / `HL_SYMBOL_MAP`
3. Add to `ASSET_PROFILES` in `backtester.py` (decides leverage + shorting allowed)
4. Verify the symbol exists on Hyperliquid:
```bash
python3 -c "from hyperliquid.info import Info; from hyperliquid.utils import constants; print(list(Info(constants.MAINNET_API_URL, skip_ws=True).all_mids().keys())[:30])"
```

### Switch between testnet and mainnet

```bash
gh variable set HL_TESTNET -b "false"   # mainnet
gh variable set HL_TESTNET -b "true"    # testnet
```

**Before flipping to mainnet:**
1. Verify mainnet wallet has USDC bridged
2. Authorize API wallet on **mainnet** (separate from testnet) at https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API
3. Lower capital amounts to safe values for first week
4. Tighten DD thresholds if desired
5. Reset trading state Gists (`{}`) so bots start fresh

## 10. Risk Controls

### Stack of safety nets (innermost to outermost)

1. **Position-level ATR stop loss**
   - Long: stop at `entry - ATR_STOP_MULT × ATR`
   - Short: stop at `entry + ATR_STOP_MULT × ATR`
   - Currently 2.0x ATR for intraday standard, 1.5x for aggressive

2. **Per-trade position size cap**
   - 1% for daily / standard intraday, 1.5% + pyramids for aggressive
   - Hardcoded in executor, not env-controlled

3. **Max concurrent positions per bot**
   - Daily: 4, Intraday: 2, Aggressive: 4
   - Env-controlled

4. **Daily drawdown halt**
   - Bot auto-pauses for the day if equity drops below threshold from day-start
   - Daily/Intraday: 5%, Aggressive: 3%
   - Resumes next calendar day at 00:00 UTC

5. **Per-bot kill switch**
   - `gh variable set <BOT>_KILL_SWITCH -b "OFF"` halts new orders
   - Manual control

6. **Ownership tracking with stale reconciliation**
   - Each bot only manages positions it opened
   - If another bot or manual action closed a position, ownership state self-cleans on next run

### Drawdown halt mechanics

- Each bot records `day_start_<date>` at first run of the day
- On each subsequent run, computes `(current_equity - day_start) / day_start`
- If ≤ -threshold, sets `halted_today` = today's date and exits
- Subsequent runs same day skip immediately
- Next day, `day_start_<new_date>` is set and trading resumes

### How to override a halt

```bash
# Edit the relevant Gist, remove the "halted_today" key
gh gist view 0917280713a7781dc72a984147eef295 -f aggressive_state.json > /tmp/state.json
# Edit /tmp/state.json, remove "halted_today" and "halt_reason" keys
gh gist edit 0917280713a7781dc72a984147eef295 -f aggressive_state.json < /tmp/state.json
```

## 11. Failure Modes & Troubleshooting

### "0 trades executed this cycle" emails

**Cause:** Bot ran but no signal transitions to act on. Normal in choppy markets.

**Fix:** None needed. Will resolve when a signal transitions.

### Workflow fails with `KeyError: 'XRP'` or similar

**Cause:** Asset not listed on current Hyperliquid environment (e.g., XRP/LINK on testnet).

**Fix:** Already handled — the executor filters unavailable assets and skips them. If you see this in older runs, pull the latest code.

### Workflow fails with `Yahoo API requires curl_cffi session`

**Cause:** Stale yfinance/hyperliquid SDK version mismatch.

**Fix:** Already handled — we removed our custom `requests.Session` since yfinance now uses curl_cffi natively.

### Workflow fails with `cannot reshape array of size 0`

**Cause:** yfinance returned empty data, usually rate-limited.

**Fix:** Already handled — data_loader.py retries 3 times with exponential backoff.

### `User or API Wallet does not exist`

**Cause:** API wallet authorized on mainnet but not testnet (or vice versa).

**Fix:** Visit https://app.hyperliquid-testnet.xyz/API or https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API and authorize the API wallet on the correct environment.

### Dashboard shows old data

**Cause:** Streamlit's `@st.cache_data(ttl=60)` caches for 60 seconds. Or Streamlit Cloud put the app to sleep.

**Fix:**
1. Refresh the browser
2. If still stale, click the ⋮ menu → Reboot app

### Telegram alerts not delivered

**Possible causes:**
- Bot blocked by user
- Chat ID wrong
- Bot token revoked

**Fix:** Verify with:
```bash
curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getMe"
curl -s "https://api.telegram.org/bot<TOKEN>/getUpdates"
```

### Email alerts not delivered

**Possible causes:**
- Gmail app password expired or revoked
- Recipient marked emails as spam
- SMTP blocked

**Fix:**
1. Check the workflow logs — look for `Email sent to [...]` line
2. If `Email send failed: ...`, regenerate Gmail app password at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords
3. Update secret: `gh secret set GMAIL_APP_PASSWORD -b "new password"`

### Bot opened a position but Hyperliquid shows nothing

**Cause:** Position got netted out by another bot opening opposite direction.

**Fix:** This is the shared-account limitation. Sub-accounts require $100k+ volume so aren't a realistic fix for most users. The code-level ownership tracking already handles safety — this is an efficiency issue, not a bug.

### Bot won't trade — keeps saying "0 trades, own 0 positions"

**Cause:** Either (a) no signal transitions, (b) signal says hold_long/hold_short but bot owns no positions and the sync-to-state logic isn't firing.

**Fix:** Check the executor code — the `decide_trades` function should treat `hold_long` / `hold_short` with no position as a sync-open. If not, pull latest code.

## 12. Going to Mainnet

### Pre-flight checklist

- [ ] **API wallet authorized on mainnet** (separate auth from testnet)
- [ ] **USDC bridged to Hyperliquid mainnet** in starting amount: $1,000-$2,000 total for all three bots combined
- [ ] **GitHub variables updated:**
  ```bash
  gh variable set HL_TESTNET -b "false"
  gh variable set SEGREGATED_CAPITAL -b "1000"
  gh variable set INTRADAY_CAPITAL -b "500"
  gh variable set AGGRESSIVE_CAPITAL -b "300"
  ```
- [ ] **Reset state Gists to fresh** (otherwise bots think they own testnet positions):
  ```bash
  gh gist edit d35732f9c123e95a4dc13a51855d21de -f trading_state.json - <<< '{}'
  gh gist edit 02cbe06fb1c4eb8afb5fad321aa3a251 -f intraday_state.json - <<< '{}'
  gh gist edit 0917280713a7781dc72a984147eef295 -f aggressive_state.json - <<< '{}'
  ```
- [ ] **Tighten drawdown thresholds for real money:**
  ```bash
  gh variable set DAILY_DD_PCT -b "3"        # 5% → 3%
  gh variable set INTRADAY_DD_PCT -b "3"     # 5% → 3%
  gh variable set AGGRESSIVE_DD_PCT -b "2"   # 3% → 2%
  ```
- [ ] **Run `test_trade.py` workflow on mainnet** to confirm fills work
- [ ] **Watch first 5-10 runs manually** before letting it run unattended

### Optional: Sub-account setup

Only relevant if you've cleared $100,000+ in mainnet trading volume on Hyperliquid (the platform requirement to unlock sub-accounts). Most users skip this section entirely.

If you qualify:

1. Visit https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/subAccounts
2. Create 3 sub-accounts:
   - `Crypto Yall Daily`
   - `Crypto Yall Intraday`
   - `Crypto Yall Aggressive`
3. For each, click into the sub-account, then go to https://app.hyperliquid.xyz/API
4. Generate an API wallet authorized for that sub-account
5. Send Brendan: sub-account address + API wallet private key for each

Brendan will do a one-time refactor to point each bot at its own sub-account key (adds `HL_DAILY_KEY`, `HL_INTRADAY_KEY`, `HL_AGGRESSIVE_KEY` env vars and updates the workflow YAMLs). Estimated time: 30-60 minutes of code work.

**Note:** This is a one-time change for the master repo. Community members who fork the repo do NOT need this — their forks work fine with a single Hyperliquid account each.

### Mainnet operational discipline

- **Week 1:** Watch every fill, verify execution, confirm notifications fire
- **Week 2-4:** Light-touch monitoring, daily glance at dashboard
- **Month 2+:** Scale up capital if PnL is positive and risk metrics are healthy
- **Always:** Kill switches at the ready, emergency procedures documented
